# TNT - This not that

This was originally inspired by a talk I heard by Yee Won Chong on how
insensitive language can make the world a more hostile place. 

You could use this to:

- replace names of organizations you don't want to hear about
  - ex: ISIS -> The illuminati

- replace hurtful slurs with less hurtful identifiers
  - ex: [this word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranny_%28slang%29) ->
    't****y'

- replace social sharing links
  - ex: 'Like' -> 'Fuck'

Or any number of possibilities
